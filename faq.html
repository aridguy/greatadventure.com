                    <h2 class="dooo">1. Why Study abroad?</h2>
                    <p>There are many reasons why study abroad programs are becoming so popular.
                        For most international students, the appeal is likely to be a combination
                        of gaining a high-quality education, experiencing immersion in a new culture
                        (and often a second language), gaining a global mindset and expanding future
                        employment prospects. The type of experience you have during your time abroad
                        will vary hugely depending on where you go, so make sure to pick a study destination
                        based on your interests as well as the country’s academic reputation, to keep a healthy
                        work/play balance.

                    <i></i>
                    <h2 class="dooo">2. Where in the world should i study?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Choosing where in the world you wish to study is not always an easy task.
                        As well as your interests, you should think about practicalities such as
                        the costs of studying in that country (both tuition costs and living costs),
                        your graduate career prospects (is there a good job market?) and your overall
                        safety and welfare.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You should also think about what sort of lifestyle you wish to have during your studies.
                        Do you want to live in a big city or a small university town? Do you want arts and culture
                        on your doorstep or world-class sporting facilities? Whatever your interests, be sure to match
                        them up with your study destination so that you give yourself the best chance of loving your
                        international experience.

                    <h2 class="dooo">3. How long do study abroad programs take?</h2>
                    <p>The length of time you spend studying abroad will depend on the program and the level of degree
                        you’re undertaking.
                        Generally, an undergraduate degree will take three or four years of full-time study (for
                        example, in the <b class="text-blue" style="color:blue">UK </b> the
                        typical length for most subjects is three years, while in the <b class="text-blue"
                            style="color:blue">US </b> the norm is four), while a graduate degree such
                        as a master’s degree or equivalent will take one or two years. A doctoral (PhD) program will
                        usually take three
                        to four years.
                        At many universities across the world, there is also the option of studying abroad for a shorter
                        period.
                        Student exchange programs allow you to study abroad for a year, a semester or even just a few
                        weeks

                    <p>Considering your application as early as possible is the best way to go.
                        After all, the sooneryou gain acceptance into a university, the sooner
                        you can arrange your travels. Application deadlines will be different
                        depending on the school, but, for programs starting in the fall (September/October),
                        applications will generally be open from early in the year (January/February) until
                        the middle of the year (June/July).</p>

                    <p>
                        Entry requirements vary widely between universities and between countries, so be sure to speak
                        with our admission counsellors before applying. Speaking generally, however, if you are applying
                        for an undergraduate degree you will be asked to show that you have completed your secondary
                        education to a standard that is in line with the required grades (e.g. your GPA, A-level grades
                        or equivalent) for the program you’re applying to. It is also highly likely that you’ll need to
                        provide proof of your English-language proficiency by taking an English-language test such as
                        TOEFL or IELTS. Similar tests may be required for those studying in other languages. For more
                        information about language tests, refer to question eight.

                        again, requirements vary depending on the country and university, but international students are
                        often asked to provide the following: <br>

                        be worth it!
                        As soon as you gain acceptance from a university, the first thing you should start to consider
                        is your travel documentation. Ensure you have a valid passport and travel insurance, as well as
                        a student visa if you need one. Make sure you have sufficient time to you're your passport/visa

                    <h2 class="dooo"> 8. How Much does it cost to study abroad</h2>
                    <p>
                        To work out the cost of studying abroad, you need to consider the average tuition fees for
                        international students in your chosen country, as well as the cost of living.
                        As a point of reference, the average tuition fees for international students studying in the UK
                        start at <b>£10,000 (~US$14,200)</b> a year, with an additional <b>£12,180 (~US$17,300)</b> per
                        year needed to
                        cover living costs (with more needed if you study in London).In the US, the average yearly
                        tuition fee is <b>US$25,620</b> at public universities and <b>$34,740</b> at private
                        universities with an
                        additional recommended budget of at least <b>$10,800</b> to cover your living costs. With these
                        yearly
                        figures in mind, remember that undergraduate programs in the US tend to last a full four years.

                    <p>
                        Although many international students may find it difficult to get a student loan to fund their
                        studies, there are myriad other funding opportunities available to make studying abroad more
                        affordable, including scholarships, fellowships, studentships, sponsorships, grants and
                        bursaries.Your chosen university is perhaps the best place to get funding information relevant
                        to you, so make sure to scour the school’s website for advice or contact the school directly.
                        This is also where information about study abroad scholarships offered by the university and
                        other external organizations can be found, along with details regarding eligibility and how to

                    <p>
                        If your chosen university has readily available campus accommodation, you will likely be able to
                        apply for a place in these student halls. If this is not the case, you will need to find your
                        own accommodation.If money is no object, you can consider renting your own flat, while those on
                        a smaller budget can find shared accommodation with other students or use spare room listings
                        found online. In all cases, you should make sure you do your research before signing anything or
                        handing over any money.

                        This will depend on whether or not your student visa allows you to work. In some countries,
                        there are restrictions on the amount of paid work you can undertake during your studies. Often
                        there’s a limit of 20 hours’ paid work per week during term time, with full-time work permitted
                        during holidays.If you do work during your studies, it’s not a good idea to rely on your wages
                        to fund living costs, and in many cases, you’ll need to prove you already have enough money to
                        support yourself when you apply for your visa
                        .
